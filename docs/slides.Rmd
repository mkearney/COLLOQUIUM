<h1 class="mytransition">Quantitative communication research is not perfect.</h1>

---

## Issues in COMS research

- Generalizability of student samples
- Attrition in panel studies
- Real-time/tracking data is expensive
- Measurement error in self-report/questionnaire data

---

## New challenges

- Fragmented media audiences and probability sampling
- Respondent fatigue/information overload
- Increasingly salient privacy concerns

<h1 class="mytransition">"The replication crisis" will inevitably
include communication studies.</h1>

---

## Replication crisis
- Recent term used to describe the inability to replicate research
  findings.
- Originates in psychology research, but applies to all social science
  research.

- Psychology

## Samples

- Convenience samples of students tend to be homogenous and
  limited in size
- Digital sources are not restricted by geography and can be massive
- In a few hours, one could, for example, stream a million tweets
  from the U.S.

## New media environment
- Media fragmentation poses several problems
	- User-level agenda setting lacks regulation <span
      class="cite">(Garrett, 2013)</span> e.g., "fake news" <span
      class="cite">(Stanford History Education Group, 2016)</span>,
      and new currency is social validation <span
      class="cite">(Messing & Westwood, 2012)</span>
- Concerns compounded by methodological problems
	- Sampling, reliability, and elusive promise of "big data" <span
      class="cite">(Garrett, 2013)</span>


---

## Partisan networks
- We know a lot about exposure to partisan news
    - e.g., theories of motivated reasoning and cognitive dissonance
      <span class="cite">(Prior, 2013)</span>
- We know relatively little about partisan [user] networks
	- We lack necessary tools to examine networks and interactions on
      a large scale <span class="cite">(Garrett, 2013)</span>
	- This was my motivation for writing *rtweet* an R package for
      collecting Twitter data<span class="cite"> (Kearney, 2016)</span>

## Selective exposure on Twitter
- Asymmetrical connections make Twitter unique
  - Estimate political ideology using user networks <span
    class="cite">(Barbera, 2015)
- My dissertation
  - I tracked networks from a random sample of Twitter users during
    the 2016 election

---

## Hypotheses
1. User networks on Twitter will cluster according to partisanship
   - Partisan network homogeneity
2. Network polarization will increase with proximity to election
   - *Change* in partisan network homogeneity

---

## Method

1. Identified every follower from 12 source, or origin, accounts
   representing 3 groups
2. Randomly sampled 10,000 followers from each group
3. Filtered out inactive/bot-like users for final sample of 3,000
&nbsp;
   - Democrat partisans (n = 1,000)
   - Republican partisans (n = 1,000)
   - Entertainment non-partisans (n = 1,000)

<h1 class="mytransition">Results</h1>

## Partisan clusters (H1)
- If partisanship organizes networks, visual evidence
  in connections should be clear
- For reference, I simulated data using two sets of parameters (null
  vs alternative model)

---

## Change in polarization (H2)
- If partisan politics amplifies partisanship, then
  network polarization should increase as the  election gets closer
- My dissertation compares *within*-user change *between*
  partisan and non-partisan groups over time using multilevel modeling

<h1 class="mytransition">Where I'm going</h1>

## Underlying research question
- How do people navigate political information in new media
  environments?
- In what ways do digital networks operate as mechanisms of political
  persuasion?
- What do patterns in social media behaviors of tell us about
  public opinion?

## Other projects
- Combining real-time Facebook API data with survey data
- Combining social media or tracking data with experimental data to
  examine framing, social validation, and media exposure
- Working with databases, parsing text, analyzing multiple models, and
  leveraging other programming languages to make things go faster and
  do more.

## Defs

Large and unstructured data impose challenges not historically
addressed by statistics (Vasant, 2013)

Machine learning is center to data science (Vasant, 2013)

---

## stats

- Statistics, more so than computer science, is condusive to knowledge
  discovery (Vasant, 2013)
	- Computer science provides tools for summarizing and subsetting
      "databases"
	- Statistics provides tools for testing and creating theories
      with "data frames"

---

## Two extremes

**Computer science** examines whether a certain pattern can be found
  in data.
  - *e.g., hey Alexa, what is the capital of Chile?*

**Statistics** examines whether data can be found in a certain
  pattern.
  - *e.g., lack of sleep correlates with decreased cognitive
    performance*

---

## Predictions

Machine learning models are judged by accuracy of their predictions

Predictive models so not attempt to *explain* what's happening
	- Impossible to know whether variables in model actually reflect
      some underlying construct (Vasant, 2013)

Data science is increasingly concerned with making predictions

---

## Data science

- Data science is "a set of fundamental principles that  support  and
  guide  the  principled  extraction  of  information  and  knowledge
  from  data" (Provost & Fawcett, 2013, p. 52)

- Big data refers to "datasets  that  are  too  large  for
  traditional data-processing systems and that therefore require new
  echnologies" (Provost & Fawcett, 2013, p. 54)
